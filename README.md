# Prismriver
Prismriver is an attempt to create a functionally styled, lightweight and portable _ensemble_ of system initialization tools.

The name "Prismriver" refers to the collection as a whole, each component is usable standalone and has its own name, and thus this repository 
is meta and links to each individually.

All components of Prismriver are written in OCaml for its sturdiness, speed, elegance and style.

### [Lyrica](https://github.com/rxse/lyrica)
A safe, comprehensible and efficient PID 1.

### [Layla](https://github.com/rxse/layla)
A reliable, simple and sane service manager. Formerly called "Merlin", however this was changed due to concern over a name clash with an unrelated project.

### Lunasa
A sensible and clean device manager.

## Goal
The aim of the Prismriver project is to create a simple and easily deployable initialization system for *NIX operating systems.
We believe in Init Freedom.
